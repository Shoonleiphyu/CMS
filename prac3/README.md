## Estimated Hours:
Approximately 12 hours (facing some problems in hosting and technical issues)

## Content Insights:
My first time using wordpress is a rough start. Hosting the website is a bit problems in my case cause I actually cannot decide which plan should I choose. However, after the hosting, here comes the editing. The editing or writing phase is pretty fun. I saw most in the forum recommend the YoastSEO plugin to boost the website in search engines. This is really a impactful plugin I must say. Astra plugin is to get icons and widgets to put in the website to support the site to boost in a way of digital marketing. Wordpress is pretty flexible compared to Joomla and a satifaction to use as a person does not know how to code. I really had fun using wordpress.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights:
Watching videos to learn is one of my favourites. So I can learn very quickly as I can see it live and visually. I paralelly did watching videos and practise what I have learned from
that videos and websites. 

Afterall, this was a really fun week learning new materials and getting so much knowledge as I was able to explore new skills.
