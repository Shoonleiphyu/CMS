## Insights:
For this assessment. I created a website with two CMS tools called Joomla and Wordpress. This is my first time using Joomla and Wordpress. These tools are very complicated first time using. Joomla needs XAMPP. However, I have used Xampp before thus, there is no problem starting the tools. Wordpress is really a very flexible tool to create websites. Everything except domain name and hosting plan is free. 
I am not really fond of Joomla compared to wordpress, it has a really complicate design which is diffcult to understand. I also had to take long time to figuring out which is which. Also the designs and plugins are not really flexible and feel like there is something retsrticted me. While wordpress has as great flexibility. With a Hostinger plugin wihch is capable for hosting the website, my journey was smooth and also YoastSEO plugin to boost my website. Astra plugin to get social icons and widgets to add in my website.
