## Estimated Hours:
Approximately 5 hours (some errors in php file hindered my work)

## Content Insights:
Child theme is a feature for the site developer to modify safely without making actual changes to parent theme. This is a useful and flexible feature in wordpress for the users.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights:
Watching videos to learn is one of my favourites. So I can learn very quickly as I can see it live and visually. I paralelly did watching videos and practise what I have learned from
that videos and websites. 

Afterall, this was a really fun week learning new materials and getting so much knowledge as I was able to explore new skills.
