# Local Development and Deployment
# Practical 4
## Week: Week4

## Learning Activities:
Learing what the local development and deployment, version control is and how to migrate live wordpress server to the localhost server.
These activities are done either in class and also from the learning videos in linkedIn learning. In practicals also, I have to practise what i have learned from the learning resources. 
I used Xampp server to setup my local environment and I also face some issues that my apache is not running and tried to solve the errors.
Except for the apache server issues everything went great and migrate my live website server in a production environment to a local environment.

## Content Insights:
Learning about version control is a very impactful thing in a web development. It helps me to understand that provides a structured approach to development. By using version control, you gain the ability to understand the evolution of your project, identify who made specific modifications, and resolve conflicts easily.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights:
Watching videos to learn is one of my favourites. So I can learn very quickly as I can see it live and visually. I paralelly did watching videos and practise what I have learned from
that videos and websites. 

Afterall, this was a really fun week learning new materials and getting so much knowledge as I was able to explore new skills.
