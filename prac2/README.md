## Week: Week2

## Learning Activities:
I have learned CMS tool called Joomla. This tool is a very useful tool to create a website. It has many resources which is needed in creating a website. It also needs a XAMPP server which is a free and open-source cross-platform web server solution stack package.

## Resources/ Links:
I have to watch youtube videos and find answers on the forum.
https://forum.joomla.org/


## Estimated Hours:
Approximately 8 hours- 4 hours per day

## Content Insights:
This is my first time using Joomla. It is very complicated first time using. It also need XAMPP. However, I have used Xampp before thus, there is no problem starting the tools. After taking my time figuring out, I think this tool is very interesting and had fun creating my website with it.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights:
Watching videos to learn is one of my favourites. So I can learn very quickly as I can see it live and visually. I paralelly did watching videos and practise what I have learned from
that videos and websites. 

Afterall, this was a really fun week learning new materials and getting so much knowledge as I was able to explore new skills.
